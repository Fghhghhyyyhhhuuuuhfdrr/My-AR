### Augmented Reality with Unity
### This is an application I developed for smartphones, smart glasses, laptop and desktop computers
### C# code I wrote in 2017
### The app reads the weather forecast for the area the phone or iPad is pointed at and overlays on the phone screen icons for the sun, rain, wind, etc., with the air temperature and other metrics in real time
### For 3D, see above video MatovAugmentedReality3Delephant_2017.MOV
